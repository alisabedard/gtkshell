# Introduction #

gtkshell is a utility that allows GUI applications to be constructed from the command line.  gtkshell includes ACE, a simple desktop and configuration environment based on gtkshell, xshell, a simplified xlib version of gtkshell, pysh, a pygtk version of gtkshell, and
gshterm, a terminal emulator implemented using gtkshell.

Current development will be moving to github shortly in the form of a new project (5 JAN 2015).  Plans include moving away from the GTK toolkit, refactoring, and a frequent release cycle.
